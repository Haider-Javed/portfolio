            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is <b class="bld">Haider Javed</b>, and I was born in a backward village near Sialkot where I
                completed my early
                education with very limited resources.
                Despite these challenges, my passion for learning and my strong desire to excel academically kept me
                motivated from an early age.
                My keen enthusiasm for modern world technology pushed me to explore computers, <b class="bld">problem
                    solving</b>, and the
                rapidly evolving field of technology on my own.
                This self-driven motivation helped me secure <b class="bld">All Pakistan Rank 18 in the NUST Entrance
                    Test</b>, marking a
                major milestone in my academic journey.
                I joined NUST and began my journey of learning, experimenting, and exploring the world of technology
                with
                a disciplined and growth-oriented mindset.
                I have strong problem-solving skills and solved more than <b class="bld">300+ LeetCode problems</b> in
                my very first
                semester, strengthening my foundations in data structures and algorithms.
                Alongside academics, I am a self-taught <b class="bld">web developer</b> and have built several
                meaningful projects by
                applying modern development practices.
                I am also a game developer and have created multiple games, which helped me develop logical thinking,
                creativity, and a deeper understanding of system design.
                I continuously push the boundaries of my brain to understand modern technologies, <b class="bld">improve
                    my skills</b>, and
                stay aligned with industry standards.
                Looking forward, my goal is to use computer science to create impact at scale and contribute to
                innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.
                Coming from humble beginnings has kept me grounded, <b class="bld">disciplined</b>, and focused as I
                move forward with a
                clear vision and long-term commitment to excellence.</p>
